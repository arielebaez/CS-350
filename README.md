SUMMARIZE THE PRJECT AND THE PROBLEM SOLVED!!
The purpose of this project was to develop a thermostat for SysTec. 
Embedded systems are an integral part of most things we use. Technology
is increasing involving and internet of things and its already a part of 
our lives. We needed to Develope a Wi-Fi enabled thermostat to be integrated 
as pat of a Smart system infastructure.

WHAT DID YOu DO WELL?
I had so much fun working on this project and the best was making a Task Scheduler.
The Scheduler shwos how multiple tasks implemented in a system using state machines.
In this project the things we did are button presses, udate the LED, and get the
temperature sensor all on diffrent timer. This all shows how to program efficiently.

WHERE COULD I IMPROVE?
Being able to work the code better and manipulate it to improve effiecieny.

WHAT TOOLS OR RESOURCES ARE YOU ADDING TO YOUR SUPPORT NETWORK?
HEADER files are a big deal for implementation detils to be sucessful. TI is a very 
good support forum to ask questions about any issues you may have. 

WHAT SKILLS FROM THIS PROJECT WILL BE PARTICULARY TRANSFERABLE TO OTHER PROJECTS OR COURSE WORK?
I learned how timers in an embedded system work; I could use this in other courses. 

HOW DID YOU MKAE THIS PROJECT MAINTAINABLE, READABLE, AND ADAPTABLE?
  The first was was making and implementing the cooperative task scheduler manage 
three tasks. We could also have done the tasks with a main code loop and 
micromanaged each task. If we would of done the before mentioned it would lead
to a spaghetti code and hard to read, understand, and adapt.
  Cooperative task scheduler makes the code organized and each tasks has a timer 
and control variables. The scheduler has a "tick" on the GCD period of all three
timers.
